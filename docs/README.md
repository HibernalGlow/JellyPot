## Manual Setup (Original Instructions)

If you prefer manual configuration or the automatic tool doesn't work, follow the detailed steps below:

This tutorial explains how to set up Jellyfin Server on Windows to:

    Launch medias from the Jellyfin web interface directly in PotPlayer.

    Optional :  One click link to the corresponding media local folder from the Jellyfin media information panel.

    Optional : Start and stop the Jellyfin server automatically at launching the web interface and closing it.
    
    Bonus : Select text and one click search selection on IMDB, YOUTUBE, or any websites

---

- Not tested with Chrome ‚Äì using LibreWolf is recommended and easier for this setup.
- You can install multiple Firefox/LibreWolf/Nightly/Any fork on the same computer. I strongly recommend to install LibreWolf separately from your main browser.
- This way you can launch Jellyfin directly in full-screen mode and/or hide the browser menu bar, as well as enabling separate configurations such as a default zoom of 120%, differents firefox addons for this browser etc...
- This also allows to use the Optional feature to start Jellyfin server automatically while launching the web interface and to stop jellyfin server after closing the window.
---

## Security Notice

- For the Optional local folder link, you need to install "native-app-setup.exe" and the firefox extension "Local Filesystem Links" by austrALIENsun, AWolf
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/feinstaub/webextension_local_filesystem_links)
- If you have security concerns, feel free not to install it.
- I have no affiliation with this extension or its creators.
- Use a separate LibreWolf/Firefox installation to minimize risks.

## Installation Steps
It's better to use Notepad++ to view this and the scripts to edits.

### 10. Optional : Needed if you don't use default path and URL for Jellyfin, Librewolf and PotPlayer

- Edit `Jellyfin.bat` `OpenMediaInfoPathScriptmonkey.js` & `OpenWithPotplayerUserscript.js`
- Those files are set to LibreWolf default path and Jellyfin Server default URL :
http://localhost:8096 and librewolf.exe path C:\Program Files\LibreWolf\librewolf.exe" Potplayer path C:\Program Files\DAUM\PotPlayer\PotPlayerMini64.exe
- If you use those settings, default settings, skip to 7.
- If not, edit the files.
- In Jellyfin.bat modify it for your **LibreWolf/Firefox path**, **process name** (Firefox.exe or LibreWolf.exe), and **Jellyfin URL**:
  ```
  curl -s http://localhost:8096 > nul
	if %errorlevel% neq 0 (ping -n 1 -w 100 127.0.0.1 > nul & goto waitForServer)
	start "" "C:\Program Files\LibreWolf\librewolf.exe" -url "http://localhost:8096/web/index.html#/home.html"

	tasklist | find /i "librewolf.exe" >nul
  ```

- If your Jellyfin Server is not set the default adress "http://localhost:8096/"
	Edit the two `.js` scripts to replace "http://localhost:8096/ with your Jellyfin web URL :
  ```
  javascript
  // @match        http://localhost:8096/web/index.html

  ```
Jellyfin.bat detects when there is no more "LibreWolf.exe" process running, then it stop Jellyfin server service process.

- potplayer.ps1 support all A-Z local drive, it may need edit if you use network drives I don't know

- README.md : You are reading it right now
- Jellyfin.bat, Jellyfin, JellyfinUAC, JellyfinUAC.xml : Only needed for the server start and stop and and shortcuts
- OpenMediaInfoPathScriptmonkey.js : backup file, it's in ViolentMonkey in your browser, only needed for local links
- OpenWithPotplayerUserscript.js : backup file, it's in ViolentMonkey in your browser

## IMPORTANT ##
- Sometimes if it stop working, because of idk, **PotPlayer updates** or some specific settings change, just **re-run** `PotPlayerMini64.reg`.
Should be fine but if it happens too often, you can add a line or create .bat to run PotPlayerMini64.reg everytime or at system startup.
- Not tested with NAS or network drives, let me know if it works, if not, .ps1 may need some tweaking.
- [Start and stop the Jellyfin server] If you close the .bat (black window) before closing the browser, the Jellyfin Server will keep running in the background.
- [Start and stop the Jellyfin server] Go to Windows `services.msc` **Jellyfin** **Startup type** **Manual** after each Jellyfin Server updates.
